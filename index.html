      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>In 1976 Book City opened its doors to the people of Toronto. Situated in the Annex, one of Toronto’s great neighbourhoods, it has been treating its customers to an eclectic range of books ever since. Toronto bibliophiles must have liked us, or our books at any rate, because forty years on we have four store locations across Toronto.</p>
      <p>Book City was founded and is still operated by a family that goes back four generations in the book business. Perhaps this is why we at Book City stick to a more traditional method of book selling. We jam our bookcases full of new and backlist titles, pack our tables high with bargains, and staff our stores with people who love reading as much as our customers do.</p>
